The deadline for submitting the report of your final project will be Dec 14 at noon (12 PM). Your report should be in 3-4 pages and should include:

    Summary of proposal and goals
    description of what you created (both what works and what does not work)
    usage instructions (how does a user build, run, and use the project)
    challenges and surprises encountered
    observations about Rust: what aspects of Rust helped or hindered your work on this project?

Again, each group needs to submit only once.
