If we want everything in one file:
- Set parse_text.rs's main() to a void function (probably named parse_text() or something)
- Change it to take one string argument (location of file), everything else is the same
- Copy/paste everything verbatim into song_structures/src/main.rs before the async blocks
- Would allow us to more easily do everything in one command line call

If we are ok having separate files:
- Move parse_text.rs to song_structures/src/bin/parse_text.rs
