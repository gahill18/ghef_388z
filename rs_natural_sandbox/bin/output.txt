Part 1: Holy Wars
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs, "do you kill on God's command?"
A country that's divided surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homeland
Holy wars...
[Verse 2]
Upon my podium as the “know-it-all scholar”
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger of God
Part 2: The Punishment Due
[Verse 3]
Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die... they die!
[Verse 4]
They killed my wife and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake... last mistake!
Paid by the alliance
To slay all the giants
Next mistake... no more mistakes!
[Guitar Solo & Instrumental Shift]
[Verse 5]
Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings
Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away

[Verse 1]
Hello, me, meet the real me and my misfits way of life
A dark, black past is my most valued possession
Hindsight is always 20-20
But looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest
[Chorus 1]
Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets
[Verse 2]
Hello, me, it's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache, sinking down to your level
Yeah, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two out of kicking distance
Mankind has got to know his limitations
[Chorus 2]
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
I hear it in here...
Blood stains on my... hands
The big axe...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
Sweating, sweating
Sweating, sweating
Sweating, sweating
[Verse 3]
Well, me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Someday, you too, will know my pain
And smile its black-toothed grin
If the war inside my head won't take a day off, I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again
[Chorus 3]
Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me, and my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
[Outro]
Once you've committed me 
(Committed me)
Now you've acquitted me 
(Acquitted me)
Claiming validity 
(Validity)
For your stupidity 
(Stupidity)
I'm chomping at the bit
I'm sharpening the axe
Oh, here I come again, whoa!
Sweating bullets
	emp genre,Part 1: Rust in Peace
[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Tremble, you weaklings, cower in fear
I am your ruler - land, sea, and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system's locked in for military gluttons
I rule on land, air, and sea
I pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head
To spit into the wind
[Chorus]
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace
[Verse 2]
Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Heh, survival, such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps
I rule land, air, and sea
Pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Well only time will tell
[Chorus]
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace
[Verse 3]
High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea
Nuclear winter, spreading disease
The day of final conflict, all pay the price
The third world war rapes peace, takes life
Back to the start, die in the pyre
When the Earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days were black as night
[Chorus]
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
Launch the Polaris
It doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace
Part 2: Polaris

Eradication of
Earth's population loves Polaris

Earth's population loves Polaris

	emp genre,[Verse 1]
Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans, denied
[Pre-Chorus]
So, as you read this, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all
[Chorus]
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
[Verse 2]
If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say
Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred
[Chorus]
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis
Je vous aime, je dois partir
These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
So, as you read, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone, that's all

These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free
À tout le monde, à tous mes amis

These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

[Verse 1]
You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a'roll
A'roll, a'roll...
[Chorus]
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony of destruction
[Verse 2]
Actin' like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, explodes...
[Chorus]
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony of destruction
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
The Earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
A'tall, a'tall...
[Chorus]
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony of destruction
	emp genre,[Verse 1]
This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money
Not for the fame
Not for the power
Just no more games
[Chorus]
But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away
[Verse 2]
You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years
Not from the use
Not from the tears
Just self-abuse
[Chorus]
But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away
[Bridge]
Who's to say what's for me to say?
Who's to say what's for me to be?
Who's to say what's for me to do?
'Cause a big nothing it'll be for me
[Verse 3]
The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel
[Verse 5]
I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twists perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You'll feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death
	emp genre,[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
What do you mean I "don't believe in God?"
I talk to him every day
What do you mean I "don't support your system?"
I go to court when I have to
What do you mean I "can't get to work on time?"
Got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean I "don't pay my bills?"
Why, do you think I'm broke? Huh?
[Refrain]
If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time
[Verse 2]
What do you mean I "hurt your feelings?"
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean I "ain't kind?"
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean I "couldn't be the president
Of the United States of America?"
Tell me something
It's still "we the people," right?
[Refrain]
If there's a new way, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

Can you put a price on peace?

Peace, peace sells
Peace, peace sells!

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

Welcome to our fortress tall
I'll take some time to show you around
Impossible to break these walls
For, you see, the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars
[Refrain]
Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Foreign life forms, inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold, but who'd suspect
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much

Bestow upon me knowledge
Wizard, all-knowing, all-wise
I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze, now defiled
Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin
Parade the grey-robed monks
The vestal virgins wheel the wyvern's in
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protégé of five magics
Give me alchemy, give me wizardry
Give me sorcery, thermatology
Electricity, 
magic if you please
Master all of these, bring him to his knees
[Bridge]
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics

Possessed with Hellish torment 
(Possessed with Hellish torment)
I master magics "five" 
(I master magics "five")
Hunting the abyss lord 
(Hunting the abyss lord)
Only one will stay alive 
(Only one will stay alive)
He who lives by the sword 
(He who lives by the sword)
Will surely also die 
(Will surely also die)
He who lives in sin 
(He who lives in sin)
Will surely live the lie

[Verse 1]
In my hour of need
Heh, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold, very cold
No one cares for me
[Verse 2]
Did you ever think I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think to stop thinking?
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too
[Refrain]
Things will be better
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you, I'm probably wrong
[Verse 3]
But, oh, how I lived my life for you
Still you'd turn away
Now, as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years, I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
Tell me who you think you are
[Bridge]
I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way
[Guitar Solo]
[Outro]
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone, I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you, alone
So alone, I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain
Won't you hold me again?
You just laughed, ha, ha, you bitch
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all things shall pass
This good thing passed away
